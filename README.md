# üöÄ PQC-Guard

A fine-tuned model based on **[Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2)**, specialized in **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**.  
This model provides enhanced reasoning across PQC domains and is suitable for research, testing, and experimentation.

---

## üìö Description

**PQC-Guard** is trained on a curated **Post-Quantum Cryptography QA dataset (~39k samples)** using **LoRA (PEFT)** on the `microsoft/phi-2` base model.

### ‚úÖ Features

- Accurate and reliable PQC recommendations (KEMs, Signatures, HPKE, Hybrid PQ-TLS, KMS, Smartcards, Hardware Integration)
- Policy-aware responses (no private keys, exploits, or sensitive material)
- Lightweight, reproducible, and easy to run on Kaggle, Google Colab, or locally

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install dependencies:


git clone https://github.com/abdulrafayishaCkER/pqc-guard
cd pqc-guard

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download LoRA Adapters

Choose one method:

A) Clone from Hugging Face (Recommended)
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/abdulrafayishaCked/pqc_guard
mv pqc_guard ./adapters

B) Programmatic Download using Python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

local_dir = snapshot_download(
    repo_id="abdulrafayishaCked/pqc_guard",
    use_auth_token=True
)

# Move or reference `local_dir` as ./adapters/pqc_guard

# Evaluation

- You can upload the evaluation notebook and LoRA adapters to Kaggle or Google Colab.

# Recommended Workflow

- Download the LoRA adapters from Hugging Face

- Zip the adapter folder and upload it to Kaggle/Colab

- Load the latest checkpoint inside the evaluation notebook

- Run inference + model testing

- You may also use the evaluation notebook directly by uploading the zipped Phi-2 LoRA model.

# Recommendations

- Use the LoRA adapter version for best compatibility

- Prefer running on GPU (T4, L4, A10G, or better)

- Ideal for PQC research, model comparison, and hybrid PQ-TLS design testing
