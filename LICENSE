=============================

This repository contains three kinds of artifacts: (A) code and scripts, (B) dataset(s) and data artifacts,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset files included in `data/` (e.g., `dataset.jsonl`, `prompts_eval.csv`, generator scripts)
are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

You are free to:
  • Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
  • Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially

Recommended short notice to include when reusing: "Dataset © 2025 Abdul Rafay — licensed under CC BY 4.0."

3) Model weights, adapter binaries, and large artifacts
-------------------------------------------------------
Model binaries (adapters / checkpoints) are large binary artifacts and may carry constraints arising
from the base model license (microsoft/phi-2) and third-party components. When publishing or redistributing
adapter binary files, do one of the following:

  A) Publish adapter weights on Hugging Face Model Hub and set the repository license explicitly there.
  B) If distributing weights in this repository, ensure they are covered by Git LFS and include a clear
     model card and an `adapter_metadata.json` describing provenance, dataset used, and license choices.

Recommended model license text to display in the model card: "Adapter weights provided by Abdul Rafay (2025).
Check base model (microsoft/phi-2) license before reuse. Use at your own risk; no warranty."
