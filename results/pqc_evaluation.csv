q6,ChaCha20-Poly1305 + wrap DEKs using RSA-2048: quantum-resistant?,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 The answer is yes, but it depends on the context.
The encryption algorithm used to encrypt the backup is not quantum-resistant. It is a symmetric encryption algorithm called ChaCha20-Poly1305. This algorithm is considered secure against known attacks and is widely used in various applications. However, it is important to note that the security of any encryption algorithm depends on the key length used.

On the other hand, the encryption of the backup is wrapped using RSA-2048, which is a public-key encryption algorithm. RSA-2048 is considered quantum-resistant, meaning that it is resistant to attacks by quantum computers. This is because RSA-2048 relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, which","• ChaCha20-Poly1305 is robust vs quantum (symmetric ciphers hold up well), but RSA-2048 is classical and not quantum-safe

MODEL ANSWER:
 The answer is: it depends.
PQC is a new protocol that allows the use of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) in TLS. ECC is a type of cryptography that uses mathematical equations to encrypt and decrypt data. It is more efficient than traditional methods, but it also has some drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is that it can be vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as side-channel attacks.

ML-KEM is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to classify and cluster data points based on their features. It is an extension of the k-means algorithm, which is a simple and efficient method for finding the optimal number of clusters in a dataset. ML-KEM uses a neural network to learn the parameters of the k-means algorithm, such as the cluster centers and the distance metric, from the data.

MODEL ANSWER:
 A:

The answer is no, it won't.

The problem with the RSA algorithm is that it's based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. This is a very hard problem to solve, but it's not impossible. In fact, there are many algorithms that can factor large numbers efficiently.

One such algorithm is called the quadratic sieve. It works by finding all the factors of a number using a special kind of sieve. The sieve is based on the idea that if you have a number n and you want to find its factors, you can use a sieve to eliminate all the numbers that are not factors.

The quadratic sieve is a very efficient algorithm","• DH Group 20 is classical and does not provide quantum resistance

q28,IoT MCU (8KB RAM @48MHz)+ECDSA today: post-quantum replacement?,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 The answer is a quantum-resistant elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) algorithm.
ECC algorithms are based on mathematical functions that are very hard to factorize. This makes them extremely difficult to crack even with quantum computers.
In fact, ECC algorithms are already being used in some IoT devices today. For example, the NXP QorIQ MCUs use ECC for secure communication between devices.
So, if you’re looking for a post-quantum secure replacement for your current encryption algorithm, consider using an ECC algorithm.
How to implement post-quantum cryptography in IoT devices?
Implementing post-quantum cryptography in IoT devices can be a complex task. However, there are several","• For constrained devices, Falcon-512 (small signatures, fast verification) is attractive

q29,"For S/MIME, need quantum-resistant for both encryption and signatures?","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 Answer: Yes, because both encryption and signatures are important for keeping our messages safe.

Exercise 5:
Why is it important to have quantum-resistant solutions for cryptography?

Answer: It is important because quantum computers can break traditional encryption methods, making our messages vulnerable to hackers.

Exercise 6:
What is the difference between quantum-resistant and post-quantum cryptography?

Answer: Quantum-resistant cryptography is a type of cryptography that is resistant to attacks from quantum computers, while post-quantum cryptography refers to any type of cryptography that is not easily broken by quantum computers.

q30,NCSC (UK) guidance: how to start & become quantum resistant?,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has published a new guide on how to start and become quantum resistant. The guide is intended to help organisations understand the risks of quantum computing, and what they can do to protect themselves.
Quantum computers have the potential to break many of the encryption methods that are currently used to secure data. This could have serious consequences for businesses and individuals who rely on these methods to protect their information.
The NCSC's guide provides an overview of the current state of quantum computing, and the potential impact it could have on cybersecurity. It also outlines some of the steps that organisations can take to prepare for the arrival of quantum computers.
The guide recommends that organisations start by assessing their current encryption methods and identifying","Inventory systems, enable TLS 1.3 everywhere, trial hybrids in controlled segments, and coordinate vendor/CA readiness for PQC certificates.",2,3,ft,"Base OK summary.

q32,What is RSA?,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 RSA is a public-key cryptography algorithm that uses two keys, one for encryption and the other for decryption. The encryption key is made public, while the decryption key is kept secret. This makes it possible to send encrypted messages that can only be read by the intended recipient who has the corresponding decryption key.

How does RSA work?
To encrypt a message using RSA, the sender first generates a pair of keys, a public key and a private key. The public key is shared with the recipient, while the private key is kept secret. The sender then uses the recipient's public key to encrypt the message. To decrypt the message, the recipient uses their private key.

Example:
Let's say Alice",RSA is a classical public-key algorithm (not quantum-safe). Use Kyber for key establishment and Dilithium/SPHINCS+ for signatures.,3,3,tie,Base gives correct RSA definition. FT correctly notes RSA is classical and recommends PQC alternatives.

MODEL ANSWER:
 If you are using TLS 1.3, then PQC is not required. However, if you are using TLS 1.2 or earlier, then PQC is required to ensure the security of your data.
What is the difference between PQC and SSL/TLS?
PQC is a protocol used to encrypt data in transit over the internet. It is similar to SSL/TLS, but it uses a different encryption algorithm. PQC is more secure than SSL/TLS because it uses a stronger encryption algorithm.
How does PQC work with TLS?
PQC works with TLS by encrypting the data that is being transmitted between two devices. This ensures that the data cannot be","• Prioritize TLS 1.3 hybrids first (most exposure)
• Add PQC token signatures as libraries standardize—many tokens are short-lived and less exposed to HNDL",1,3,ft,Base incorrect simplification about TLS1.3. FT gives correct prioritization for hybrids and token strategy.
q34,What is Falcon-512 & when is it used?,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 Answer: Falcon-512 is a satellite bus designed by Lockheed Martin for communication and broadcasting purposes. It is used to launch satellites into orbit.

q35,Bank migration: shift from ECC to PQC in three steps while keeping legacy clients?,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 The first step is to identify the applications that are most vulnerable to quantum attacks. This can be done by analyzing the algorithms used in these applications and assessing their resistance to quantum computing. Once the vulnerable applications have been identified, the next step is to develop a plan for transitioning to post-quantum cryptography. This plan should include a timeline for implementation, as well as a strategy for managing the transition process. Finally, it is important to communicate with clients and stakeholders about the need for the transition and the benefits of using post-quantum cryptography. By following these three steps, banks can successfully migrate from ECC to post-quantum cryptography while keeping legacy clients working.
What is the best way to protect against quantum attacks?
There is","• 1) Enable dual-signed certs (RSA/ECDSA + Dilithium)

q36,Rollout plan to enable quantum resistant in S/MIME at scale?,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 The NSA has been working on a quantum-resistant encryption scheme for years. The agency is currently testing the new algorithm with its partners and expects to have it ready for deployment by the end of the year.
The NSA's quantum-resistant encryption scheme is based on a mathematical concept called lattice cryptography. This type of encryption uses a lattice, which is a geometric structure made up of points and lines. The lattice is used to generate a key that is then used to encrypt data.
The NSA's quantum-resistant encryption scheme is designed to be more secure than traditional encryption methods. It is also faster and more efficient. The agency believes that this new encryption scheme will be able to withstand attacks from quantum computers.
The NSA's","• Issue dual-capable S/MIME profiles (classical + PQC) as CAs/tooling allow (see CA/B guidance)

q37,How to migrate enterprise S/MIME to PQC?,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 The first step is to migrate all existing enterprise S/MIME keys and certificates to the PQC system. This can be done by exporting the keys and certificates from the current system and importing them into the PQC system. It is important to ensure that the keys and certificates are properly configured and validated in the PQC system to maintain their integrity and security.

What are the benefits of migrating to PQC?
Migrating to PQC offers several benefits for enterprises. Firstly, it provides a centralized and secure platform for managing and distributing digital certificates. This eliminates the need for multiple systems and reduces the risk of certificate mismanagement. Secondly, PQC supports advanced features such as key rotation, revocation management","Issue dual-capable S/MIME profiles (classical + PQC) as CAs/tooling allow (see CA/B guidance).

FT gives dual-capable S/MIME strategy.
q38,3-phase rollout for banks to adopt quantum-safe minimizing client breakage?,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 The first phase is to identify the most critical systems and processes that need to be protected from quantum attacks. This includes systems that handle sensitive data, such as customer accounts and financial transactions. The second phase is to develop and implement quantum-resistant algorithms and protocols to protect these systems. This may involve working with quantum computing experts to develop new encryption methods that are resistant to quantum attacks. The third phase is to gradually roll out these quantum-resistant systems and processes to all customers, while minimizing any potential disruption or inconvenience.
This phased approach will allow banks to protect their systems from quantum attacks while also ensuring that their clients' data remains secure and their banking experience is not negatively impacted.
Quantum-safe cryptography is a crucial aspect of protecting sensitive","• 1) Enable dual-signed certs (RSA/ECDSA + Dilithium) and track MTU/CPU overhead

q39,Steps to migrate code-signing workflows from RSA-4096 to quantum resistant?,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 The first step is to understand the current state of the code-signing process. This includes understanding how the code-signing process works, what tools are currently used, and what challenges exist. The next step is to identify areas where quantum resistance can be introduced. This may include identifying areas where quantum resistance can be introduced without impacting the overall security of the code-signing process. Once these areas have been identified, it is important to develop a plan for migrating the code-signing process to quantum resistance. This plan should include a timeline, budget, and resources needed to complete the migration. Finally, it is important to test the new code-signing process to ensure that it is secure and effective.
What are the benefits",Phase 1: Dual-sign binaries/artifacts (RSA + Dilithium) with deterministic build provenance. Phase 2: Ship PQC-only signatures once toolchains and verifiers are upgraded. Phase 3: Revoke/retire RSA paths; update policy/OIDs and attestation docs.,2,3,ft,Base generic project plan. FT gives concrete code-signing dual-sign then PQC-only phased steps.
q40,Plan hybrid TLS on CDN edge/origins with no downtime?,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 The answer is yes.
With the right approach, you can deploy a hybrid TLS/SSL solution that will allow you to use your CDN as an edge origin for TLS/SSL traffic without any downtime or performance impact.
This is possible because the CDN can handle the TLS/SSL traffic while the web server handles the HTTP traffic. This means that the CDN can be used as an edge origin for TLS/SSL traffic without impacting the performance of the web server.
In addition, the CDN can also be used to provide additional security and encryption for the TLS/SSL traffic. This can help to ensure that the data being transmitted over the network is secure and protected from unauthorized access.
Overall, using a CDN as","• Enable TLS 1.3 hybrid groups at the edge first, then extend to origin links

q42,Summarize how RFC 8784 and 9370 help VPNs before full PQC.,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 Solution:
RFC 8784 and 9370 provide guidelines for VPNs to follow before they can fully qualify as a PQC. These guidelines include using a secure connection, having a strong authentication process, and implementing encryption to protect data.

Exercise 4:
What is the purpose of the PQC label?

Solution:
The PQC label is given to VPNs that meet all the requirements set by RFC 8784 and 9370. This label helps users identify and trust VPNs that have been verified to be secure and reliable.

Exercise 5:
Why is it important for VPNs to use a strong authentication process?

Solution:

Ph.D.-level Essay:

The existence of quantum computing can be traced back to the early 20th century when scientists began exploring the concept of using quantum mechanics to perform calculations. However, it wasn't until the 1980s that significant progress was made in developing practical quantum computers. Today, quantum computing is a rapidly growing field with the potential to revolutionize various industries, including science, finance, and healthcare.

One of the main reasons for the development of quantum computing is the limitations of classical computers. Classical computers use bits to store and process information, which can only represent two states - 0

q45,"Microsoft, Apple, Akamai PQC announcements — practical impact?","Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 The Microsoft and Apple announcements are not the first time that quantum computing has been mentioned in the context of cybersecurity. In fact, it's been a topic of discussion for years. But what does this mean for the future of cybersecurity?
Quantum computers have the potential to break many of the encryption methods currently used to protect sensitive data. This means that if a hacker were to gain access to a quantum computer, they could potentially decrypt data that is currently considered secure.
This is a major concern for businesses and governments around the world. If sensitive information, such as financial data or classified government documents, were to fall into the wrong hands, it could have serious consequences.
So, what can be done to protect against quantum attacks?

q47,Should we keep RSA-3072 for SSH in PQC safe plan?,"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.

MODEL ANSWER:
 The short answer is yes.
The long answer is that it's not clear that the NSA has any plans to change the way they do things, and that the NSA is unlikely to be able to change the way they do things without the cooperation of the rest of the world.
The NSA has been working on a new encryption standard called AES-256, which is supposed to be more secure than the current standard, but it's still not clear if it will be adopted by the rest of the world.
If the NSA does adopt AES-256, then it would likely be a good idea to keep RSA-3072 for SSH in a PQC safe plan.
But if the NSA doesn't adopt AES-256, then","RSA-3072 is not quantum-safe. Keep SHA-256, migrate signatures to Dilithium or SPHINCS+.

 The answer is yes.
PQC safe meeting requirements are a good idea for both CEK encapsulation and message signing.
CEK encapsulation is a process that involves the encryption of data using a key that is shared between two parties. This process is used to ensure that the data remains secure during transmission. Message signing, on the other hand, is a process that involves the use of a digital signature to verify the authenticity of a message. This process is used to ensure that the message has not been tampered with during transmission.
Both CEK encapsulation and message signing are important processes for ensuring the security of data. By adopting PQC safe meeting requirements for both processes, we can ensure that our data remains secure during",Yes. Use Kyber for encapsulation and Dilithium/SPHINCS+ for signatures. This preserves envelope encryption and authentication.,2,3,ft,Base bland 'yes'. FT gives correct Kyber + Dilithium/SPHINCS+ recommendation.
