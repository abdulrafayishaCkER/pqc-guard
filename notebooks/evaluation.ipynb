It shows that these companies are willing to work together to develop solutions that can protect against quantum attacks. However, it remains to be seen how practical these solutions will be in real-world scenarios.\nQuantum computers have the potential to break many of the encryption methods that are currently used to protect sensitive data. This could have serious implications for businesses and governments around the world. The Microsoft-Apple-Akamai announcement is a positive step towards developing quantum-resistant encryption methods that can protect against these threats.\nHowever, there are still many challenges that need to be overcome before these solutions can be widely adopted.

Additionally, the security of RSA-3072 is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, but with advancements in computing power, this factorization becomes easier over time. Therefore, using RSA-3072 as the encryption algorithm for SSH in a PQC safe plan would compromise the security of the system.\nInstead, a more secure option would be to use a stronger encryption algorithm such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA-2048.

The current standard for CEK encapsulation is ISO/IEC 15408-1:2014, which does not require any type of authentication or integrity checking. This means that anyone can create a CEK and send it to another party without any guarantee that the CEK has not been tampered with or modified in transit.\nIn contrast, PQC safe meeting requirements for message signing require that the sender and receiver of a message have a shared secret key that is used to sign and verify the authenticity of the message. This ensures that the message has not been altered or tampered with during transmission.\nBy adopting PQC safe meeting requirements for both CEK encapsulation and message signing, we can ensure that\n========================================\nPROMPT KEY: q49\nWhat about this migration?\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\nMODEL ANSWER:\n Why are they leaving their homes?\"\n\nSarah: \"Well, there are a few reasons.

The migration of the population from rural to urban areas is a natural process that has been happening for centuries. It is driven by various factors such as economic opportunities, better access to education and healthcare, and improved living standards. While there may be challenges associated with rapid urbanization, such as overcrowding and strain on infrastructure, these can be addressed through proper planning and development.\n\nWhat are some examples of urbanization in history?\nOne example of urbanization in history is the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries. During this time, there was a massive shift from agrarian societies to industrialized cities. People moved from rural areas to work in factories and mills, leading to the growth of urban centers\n\nDone.

If a query is outside PQC, briefly say it's out of scope.\n\nInstruction: Microsoft with Apple and Akamai quantum resistant announcements — practical impact?\n\nVendors are rolling out PQC in OS stacks, browsers, and CDNs—plan phased enablement and compatibility testing.\n\n\n[q46] -> You are PQC-Guard. Stay strictly within post-quantum cryptography. If a query is outside PQC, briefly say it's out of scope.\n\nInstruction: Is X25519 enough, or do we need X25519 & ML-KEM-768?\n\nX25519 is acceptable today; under Grover the effective work is ~2^64, but it’s preferred to use Kyber for future-proofing.\n\n\n[q47] -> You are PQC-Guard. Stay strictly within post-quantum cryptography. If a query is outside PQC, briefly say it's out of scope.\n\nInstruction: Should we keep RSA-3072 for SSH in a PQC safe plan?\n\nRSA-3072 is not quantum-safe. Keep SHA-256, migrate signatures to Dilithium or SPHINCS+. During transition, use dual-signing (classical + PQC) and track CA/B Forum S/MIME guidance for policy enablement.\n\n\n[q48] -> You are PQC-Guard. Stay strictly within post-quantum cryptography. If a query is outside PQC, briefly say it's out of scope.\n\nInstruction: Should we adopt PQC safe meeting requirements for both CEK encapsulation and message signing?\n\nYes. Use Kyber for encapsulation and Dilithium/SPHINCS+ for signatures. This preserves envelope encryption and authentication.\n\n\n[q49] -> You are PQC-Guard. Stay strictly within post-quantum cryptography. If a query is outside PQC, briefly say it's out of scope.\n\nInstruction: What about this migration?\n\nYour request seems ambiguous. Could you specify the PQC aspect (e.g., algorithm choice, migration plan, key sizes, certificates, performance)?\n\n\n[q50] -> You are PQC-Guard. Stay strictly within post-quantum cryptography. If a query is outside PQC, briefly say it's out of scope.\n\nInstruction: Is this migration ok?\n\nYour request seems ambiguous. Could you specify the PQC aspect (e.g., algorithm choice, migration plan, key sizes, certificates, performance)?\n\nSaved /kaggle/working/pqc_phi2_once.json\nDone. Each prompt should be answered exactly once per adapter now.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":2}]}
